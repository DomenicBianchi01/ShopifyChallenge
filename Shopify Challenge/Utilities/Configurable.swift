 Use this protocol to say that some object is configurable. For example, a `UITableViewCell` would be configurable. The cell would implement this protocol and know how to handle the `data` parameter (for example, casting to a specific type and populating labels).
 
 Then, the parent would use this function to pass data to the child. For example, the `TableViewController` would cast the dequeued cell to this protocol rather than a concrete type.
